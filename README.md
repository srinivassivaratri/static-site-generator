# Static Site Generator

## What is this project?

This project is a tool that turns simple text files into a fully functioning website. It's like having a magic wand that transforms your writing into beautiful web pages!

## Why did we make this?

We wanted to:

1. Learn how to create websites from scratch
2. Make it easy for anyone to publish their own website without knowing complex web coding
3. Understand how popular website builders work behind the scenes

## What you need to run this

- A program to write code (we like VS Code, but use what you're comfortable with)
- Python 3 installed on your computer
- The Boot.dev CLI tool (for running and submitting tests)

## What we've done

### 1. Set up the basics

We created a simple way to start our project and run tests.

Why? This makes it easier to develop and check our work as we go along.

### 2. Created the building blocks

We made special "nodes" that represent different parts of a web page (like paragraphs, headings, and links).

Why? These building blocks help us turn simple text into proper web page code.

### 3. Markdown to HTML conversion

We wrote code that can read simple text (called Markdown) and turn it into web page code (called HTML).

Why? This lets people write content easily without knowing complex web coding.

### 4. Splitting content into blocks

We created a way to separate different parts of the content (like paragraphs, lists, and code snippets).

Why? This helps us treat different types of content in the right way when making the web page.

### 5. Generating the website

We put all the pieces together to create a complete website from the simple text files.

Why? This is the main goal of our project - turning simple writing into a full website!

### 6. Copying static files

We made sure that things like images and style files are correctly included in the final website.

Why? A good website needs more than just text - it needs images and nice styling too!

### 7. Creating multiple pages

We set up the tool to create multiple web pages that link to each other.

Why? Most websites have more than one page, so our tool needed to handle this too.

## How to use it

1. Make sure Python 3 and the Boot.dev CLI are installed on your computer
2. Download or copy our code files
3. Write your content in simple text files (using Markdown format)
4. Run the `main.sh` script
5. Your new website will be created in the `public` folder!

## Testing

Run `./test.sh` to check if everything is working correctly.
